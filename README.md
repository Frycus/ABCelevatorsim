# ABCelevatorsim
The program is a discrete event simulation of an elevator in a 10 floor building written in C++. 
The simulation is performed using the ABC method. The output of the program should collect the following data: 
the elevator's average working time, the average length of the ground floor queue, the average waiting 
time in the queue for the elevator on floors 1 to 10 (needs a correction). The project requires boost 1.60.0
